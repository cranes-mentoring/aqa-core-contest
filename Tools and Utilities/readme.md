**2. Tools and Utilities:**

*Test Automation:*
- **Programming Language Choice:**
    - *Java:*
        - Learn the core concepts of Java, such as variables, data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
        - Example: Write a simple Java program to demonstrate OOP concepts, creating classes for a basic object like "Car" with attributes and methods.

    - *Python:*
        - Understand Python basics, including variables, data types, loops, and functions. Explore Pythonic features such as list comprehensions and generators.
        - Example: Create a Python script to automate a repetitive task, such as renaming files in a directory based on specific criteria.

- **Test Automation Frameworks:**
    - *Java: Selenium WebDriver with TestNG or JUnit.*
        - Learn how to set up a Selenium WebDriver project using either TestNG or JUnit as the testing framework.
        - Example: Develop a Selenium test script to automate the login functionality of a web application using TestNG annotations.

    - *Python: Selenium WebDriver with PyTest or Unittest.*
        - Explore the basics of using Selenium WebDriver with PyTest or Unittest for test automation.
        - Example: Write a PyTest script to automate the validation of form submissions on a website.

- **Additional Automation Tools:**
    - *Java: Cucumber, JUnit, TestNG, Maven.*
        - Understand the role of Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) and integrate it with JUnit or TestNG.
        - Example: Create a BDD scenario using Cucumber to test the search functionality of an e-commerce website.

    - *Python: PyTest, Behave, Robot Framework, pip.*
        - Explore the features of Behave for BDD and the Robot Framework for keyword-driven testing. Learn package management with pip.
        - Example: Develop a Robot Framework test suite for testing API endpoints.

*Version Control:*
- **Git:**
    - Learn the basics of Git, including repository creation, branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
    - Example: Set up a local Git repository, make changes, create branches, and merge changes to understand version control concepts.

*Build Tools:*
- *Java: Maven or Gradle.*
    - Understand the structure of a Maven project, define dependencies, and manage the project lifecycle.
    - Example: Create a Maven project for a Java application, specifying dependencies and running build commands.

- *Python: setuptools or pip.*
    - Explore setuptools for packaging Python projects and pip for package installation.
    - Example: Create a Python package using setuptools and publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

*Bug Tracking:*
- **Bug Tracking Tools:**
    - Familiarize yourself with bug tracking tools like Jira, Bugzilla, or others.
    - Example: Use Jira to report a bug, including details such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
