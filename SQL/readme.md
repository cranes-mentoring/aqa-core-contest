**6. SQL:**

*Basic SQL Concepts:*
- **Definition and Purpose:**
    - Understand SQL (Structured Query Language) as a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
    - Example: Write a simple SQL query to retrieve all records from a table.

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
    - Learn DDL commands for creating, altering, and dropping database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.
    - Example: Create a new table to store information about employees, defining columns for attributes like name, ID, and department.

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
    - Explore DML commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data from a database.
    - Example: Write SQL statements to insert employee records into the previously created table and update their information.

*Querying and Retrieving Data:*
- **SELECT Statement:**
    - Master the SELECT statement for querying data from one or more tables, applying filters and sorting.
    - Example: Retrieve all employees from the table who belong to the 'IT' department and order the results by their names.

- **Joins and Relationships:**
    - Understand different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables.
    - Example: Perform a LEFT JOIN between the 'employees' and 'departments' tables to fetch a list of all employees with their corresponding department names.

- **Subqueries:**
    - Learn to use subqueries within SQL statements for more complex queries.
    - Example: Use a subquery to find employees whose salary is above the average salary for their department.

*Data Integrity and Constraints:*
- **Primary Key and Foreign Key:**
    - Understand the concept of primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
    - Example: Define primary keys for tables and establish foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.

- **Unique and Check Constraints:**
    - Learn about unique constraints to enforce uniqueness in columns and check constraints to restrict data values.
    - Example: Add a unique constraint to ensure that employee email addresses are unique across the organization.

*Advanced SQL Concepts:*
- **Stored Procedures and Functions:**
    - Explore the creation and execution of stored procedures and functions for code reusability.
    - Example: Write a stored procedure to calculate the average salary for employees in a specific department.

- **Views:**
    - Understand how views provide a virtual representation of data based on a SELECT query.
    - Example: Create a view that displays a summarized list of employee details based on specific criteria.

- **Indexes:**
    - Learn about indexing to optimize the retrieval of data from large tables.
    - Example: Create an index on the 'employee_id' column to improve the performance of queries that involve searching by employee ID.
