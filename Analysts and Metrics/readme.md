**5. Analysts and Metrics:**

*Software Metrics Fundamentals:*
- **Definition and Purpose:**
    - Understand the role of metrics in software development and testing, focusing on quantitative measurements to assess the quality and performance of software.
    - Example: Identify key metrics such as code coverage, defect density, and test pass rate and understand how they contribute to the overall quality assessment.

- **Types of Metrics:**
    - Explore various categories of metrics, including product metrics (related to the product itself) and process metrics (related to the development and testing processes).
    - Example: Differentiate between product metrics like response time and process metrics like defect arrival rate, highlighting their relevance in different contexts.

*Requirements Analysis in Testing:*
- **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM):**
    - Learn to create and use an RTM to link requirements to test cases, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
    - Example: Develop an RTM for a project, mapping each functional requirement to the corresponding test case and updating it as new requirements are introduced.

- **Risk Analysis:**
    - Understand the importance of risk analysis in software testing, including identifying and prioritizing potential risks.
    - Example: Conduct a risk analysis for a software project, considering factors such as complexity, resource constraints, and external dependencies.

*Test Reporting and Metrics Tools:*
- **Testing Tools for Metrics:**
    - Familiarize yourself with testing tools that facilitate the collection and analysis of metrics, such as Jira, TestRail, or Zephyr.
    - Example: Use Jira to generate reports on test execution progress, defect status, and overall project health.

- **Dashboard Creation:**
    - Learn to create dashboards summarizing key metrics for stakeholders, providing a visual representation of project status.
    - Example: Build a dashboard using tools like Tableau or Grafana, incorporating metrics like test pass rates, code coverage, and defect trends.

*Defect Analysis and Reporting:*
- **Defect Life Cycle:**
    - Understand the stages of the defect life cycle, from identification and logging to resolution and verification.
    - Example: Track the life cycle of a defect in a bug tracking tool, demonstrating how it progresses through states like "Open," "In Progress," "Resolved," and "Closed."

- **Defect Density and Trends:**
    - Analyze defect density to assess the quality of the codebase and identify trends in defect occurrence.
    - Example: Calculate defect density by dividing the number of defects by the size of the codebase and analyze trends over multiple releases to identify areas for improvement.

*Performance Metrics:*
- **Performance Testing Metrics:**
    - Learn about performance testing metrics, including response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
    - Example: Conduct performance testing on a web application, measuring and analyzing metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.

- **Scalability and Load Testing:**
    - Understand how to assess the scalability of an application through load testing and analyze performance under different load conditions.
    - Example: Perform load testing on an e-commerce website to determine its capacity to handle a specified number of concurrent users.
