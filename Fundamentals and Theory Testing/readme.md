**1. Fundamentals and Theory Testing:**

*Understanding Software Testing Fundamentals:*
   - **Definition and Purpose:** Learn the fundamental definition of software testing as a process to evaluate a system's functionality and identify defects. Understand the importance of testing in ensuring software quality.
   - **Types of Testing:** Dive into various testing types, including functional testing, non-functional testing (performance, security, usability), and manual vs. automated testing. Explore how each type contributes to the overall testing strategy.

*Testing Methodologies:*
   - **Waterfall vs. Agile:** Understand the differences between traditional Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Learn how testing integrates into each methodology and the advantages and disadvantages of both.
   - **V-Model:** Explore the V-Model, emphasizing the relationship between development phases and corresponding testing phases. Understand the importance of testing at each stage.

*Test Case Design and Execution:*
   - **Test Case Components:** Learn the key components of a test case, including test inputs, expected outcomes, and preconditions. Understand how to create effective and reusable test cases.
   - **Test Case Execution:** Gain practical experience in executing test cases manually. Use simple examples to demonstrate the step-by-step process of test case execution.

*Requirements Analysis in Testing:*
   - **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Learn how to create and use an RTM to ensure that each requirement is covered by test cases. Understand the importance of tracing defects back to the corresponding requirements.

*Example Scenario:*
   - Consider a hypothetical e-commerce website. Learn to identify different testing types applicable, such as functional testing to validate the checkout process, performance testing to ensure scalability, and security testing to protect user data. Create test cases for common user interactions like adding items to the cart, making a purchase, and handling payment errors.
